List of experiments (07-08-2014 to 14-08-2014)

1. Design a 1-bit full adder with a, b and Cin as inputs and sum and Cout as 
     outputs. 
2. Realize a 32-bit ripple-carry adder using the above as the building block.

Do the following steps for each of the above experiments:

   (i) A Verilog behavioral description;
  (ii) A test bench generator module and test the circuit;
 (iii) A Verilog structural description;
  (iv) Test it using the same module as in (ii);
   (v) Synthesize the behavioural code of (i) using the FPGA kit;
  (vi) Measure some performance metircs like area, delay, number of LUTs;
 (vii) Synthesize the structural description of (iii) using the FPGA kit;
(viii) Measure the performance using the same metrics as in (vi) and compare
        the performance of the two synthesized units.
