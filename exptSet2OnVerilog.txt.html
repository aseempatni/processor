1. Realize a 4-bit carry lookahead adder comprising the following two      submodules:  (i) the sum module having A[i.3 : i.0], B[i.3 : i.0], C[i.3 : i.0] as inputs       and       S[i.3 : i.0] as outputs;      the input C[i.0] is the carry-in from the previous nibble fed as an       external input when i = 0 and from the inter-nibble CL unit for i &gt; 0;      thus, the inputs C[i.3:i.1] are from the intra-nibble CL unit described       below, (ii) the intra-nibble CL module having A[i.3:i.0], B[i.3:i.0, C[i.0] as inputs       and as outputs        (a) C[i.3:i.1] for consumption in the sum-module as indicated above,       (b) P[i] -- inter-nibble carry-propagate for consumption by the              inter-nibble CL unit (to be realized in experiment 2A given below,       (c) G[i] -- inter-nibble carry-generate for consumption by the              inter-nibble CL unit.  2A. Realize a 16-bit adder with an inter-nibble carry lookahead comprising the     following submodules:    (i) 4 modules of carry lookahead adder, realized in experiment 1,     and    (ii) an inter-nibble CL unit for the four nibbles with inputs        (a) carry-in c0 from previous 4 nibble block (for cascading),         (b) inter-nibble carry propagate inputs p[3:0] to be driven by the             outputs P[i], 0 &lt;= i &lt;= 3, from the 4 modules of (i)  and         (c) inter-nibble carry generate inputs g[3:0] to be driven by                    G[i], 0 &lt;= i &lt;= 3, from the 4 modules of (i).      and outputs:        (a) inter-nibble carry outputs C[i+1], 0 &lt;= i &lt;= 3, of which the first            three (for 0 &lt;= i &lt;= 2) are fed as C[i+1.0] inputs to the higher significant three&nbsp; modules             of 2A(i); the input C{0.0] of the 0th nibble is fed with carry-in. The final carry out is provided by C[4] output of the inter-nibble CL unit.      2B. Realize a 32-bit adder using two 16-bit adder modules of experiment 4.     ---- Reference: Patterson and Hennessy, Computer Organization and Design.  Do the following for each of the above experiments:     (i) A Verilog behavioral description;   (ii) A test bench generator module and test the circuit;  (iii) A Verilog structural description;   (iv) Test it using the same module as in (ii);    (v) Synthesize the behavioural code of (i) using the FPGA kit;   (vi) Measure some performance metircs like area, delay, number of LUTs;  (vii) Synthesize the structural description of (iii) using the FPGA kit; (viii) Measure the performance using the same metrics as in (vi) and compare         the performance of the two synthesized units.
